## Installation

Download or clone the project:

```
npm install -g bower
npm install -g polymer-cli
bower install
```

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Polymer in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
